This project is a Region Plug-in for Oracle APEX that let's you easily create some nice, responsive Material Design Cards. These Cards can be shown in a small view with just an icon or in a larger view with Chartist Charts. You can also use the cards without APEX. Just download all files and start index.html.

The Cards are data driven so you don't need to worry about the UI presentation. You only have to change the JSON in "data\data.js".

When you use these Cards in Apex, the complete help and some sample statements are inside of the Region Plug-in.
if you don't to know how to install this Plug-in in Apex, please take look at the API of Oracle Apex.
